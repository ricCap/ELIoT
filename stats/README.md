# Offline statistics for ELIoT

In this folder you can find a Jupyter Notebook that does some post-processing of Prometheus timeseries in order to extract further information from the ELIOT execution.

Run `jupyter notebook` in the folder after installing it in jour system.

You will need to create a `/data` folder here and store `.csv` exports of the required timeseries for the notebook to work.

The necessary information are provided in the notebook itself.
